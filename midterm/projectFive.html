Project information:
<br>
 <br>
 As we begin to perform more and more of our daily tasks in digital spaces, we find that most conversations happen over text message rather than in-person. However, our own experiences and research has made it clear that in their current form, text messages cause many opportunities for miscommunication. Whether that is the lack of nonverbal cues they afford or how people tend to multitask when texting, it is difficult to maintain clear communication over text, specifically for conversations of  complex subject matter. In this project, I look at how body language and facial expression signify emotions. Taking inspiration from their cues, I attempt to redesign the structure of text messages to increase emotion recognition. The goal is to create a visual experience that does not require a dictionary to understand. 
 <br>
 <br>
 The process was to create a set of designs. These designs were then placed in context of text conversation and then shown to participants. Participants were asked to interpret the emotion the design was attempting to convey. Then I quantified which signifiers offered the least (and most) miscommunication of emotion. The signifiers that assisted the most with emotion recognition were selected as final designs. 
 <br>
<br>
 Overall, the results found that color adjustments to the text message bubble and stylized text, specifically adjusting the letter spacing, best indicated emotions. Darker colors with smaller spacing were associated with anxiety and depression while lighter colors with wider spacing, were associated with happiness. Meanwhile, darker colors with wider spacing were associated with tiredness or anger. While these variations seem wide, the actual text message made the exact emotion (whether it was tired or anger) clear.
